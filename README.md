</p>

Welcome to the Moss Machine project! This open-source initiative provides a comprehensive system for automating the sorting, recognition, and management of Trading Card Game (TCG) cards. The system supports **317 different card games** including Magic: The Gathering, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and many others.

---

### Overview

The Moss Machine combines perceptual hash-based computer vision, multi-threaded processing, and hardware integration to create a high-performance, scalable card sorting solution. Whether you're a collector, player, or developer, this project offers tools and guidance to build your own automated card sorting system with speeds capable of processing cards in under 2 seconds per scan.

## Legal & Usage Notice

**Disclaimer:**  
This system is intended for hobbyist and educational use. Always test with non-valuable cards first. Handle valuable or rare cards with care—never trust automated sorting in critical scenarios. The project is open source; use at your own risk.
